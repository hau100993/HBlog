Sure, here is a summary of the most important things to know about std::thread in C++:

std::thread is a class that represents a single thread of execution.

You can create a new thread using the constructor of std::thread. For example:

```c++
std::thread my_thread(my_function, arg1, arg2);
```
This creates a new thread that executes my_function(arg1, arg2).

When a std::thread object is destroyed, the thread it represents is terminated. You can wait for a thread to finish using the join() method:

```c++
my_thread.join();
```
Threads can share data using shared variables. To avoid race conditions, you should use mutexes to synchronize access to shared data.

You can use std::mutex to create a mutex, std::lock_guard to acquire a lock on a mutex, and std::unique_lock to acquire a lock that can be released and re-acquired.

You can use std::condition_variable to wait for a condition to become true, and to signal other threads when the condition changes. For example:

```c++
Copy code
std::mutex mutex;
std::condition_variable cv;

bool data_ready = false;

void producer() {
    // ... produce data ...
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
        data_ready = true;
    }
    cv.notify_one();
}

void consumer() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
    cv.wait(lock, []{ return data_ready; });
    // ... consume data ...
}
```

In this example, the producer function produces some data and sets the data_ready flag to true. It then notifies the cv condition variable. The consumer function waits for the data_ready flag to become true using the cv.wait method. When the condition variable is notified, the consumer thread wakes up and consumes the data.

You can pass arguments to a thread function using std::ref and std::move:

```c++
void my_function(int& arg1, std::string&& arg2) {
    // ...
}

int i = 42;
std::string s = "hello";
std::thread my_thread(my_function, std::ref(i), std::move(s));
```

In this example, the arg1 parameter is passed by reference using std::ref, and the arg2 parameter is moved into the thread function using std::move.

You can set the thread priority using std::thread::native_handle() and platform-specific functions. For example, on Linux, you can use pthread_setschedparam():

```c++
#include <thread>

void set_thread_priority(std::thread& thread, int priority) {
    pthread_t handle = thread.native_handle();
    sched_param params;
    params.sched_priority = priority;
    pthread_setschedparam(handle, SCHED_FIFO, &params);
}
```

This function sets the priority of a thread to the given value using the pthread_setschedparam function.

You can use std::async to create a new thread and return a future object that can be used to retrieve the result of the thread function:

```c++
std::future<int> result = std::async(std::launch::async, my_function, arg1, arg2);
int value = result.get();
```
